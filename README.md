For writing the code and documentation, I am getting help from GitHub Copilot. 

## Java Application overview

This is a Java Spring Boot application. The application has following depndencies:

- Spring Web

- h2 Database
  
in the branch `api` we will create a restful API that will allow us to create, read, update and delete employees from a database. 

## How Copilot helped me to write the code?

I used GitHub Copilot to write the code and documentation. I used Copilot suggestions in the `editor` and via `chat`. 

I used these 2 methods to get help from Copilot:

1. Copilot suggestions in the editor
2. Copilot suggestions in the chat

### Copilot suggestions in the editor

There are following ways Copilot suggests code in the editor:

1. When I write a comment, Copilot suggests code based on the comment.
2. When I write a method, Copilot suggests the method body.
3. Autocomplete suggestions based on the context.
4. Inline chat suggestions.
5. Explaination of the code.
6. Fix the code
7. Generate codes
8. Generate test
